First Experiments trying around with data types, file formats etc. 

Currently encodes text via a custom (?) algorithm dividing each char-byte into 4 * 2 bits, then modifies the RGBA values accordingly

- UNSCRAMBLING UNTESTED -

To-Do:
Implements unscrambling / readout of hidden text
Add cryptographic noise & pseudorandom distribution of data
